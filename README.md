# Minimal Networks
Initially I did this algorithm as part of a HackerRank challenge.
It is an implementation of the Prim's algorithm for finding the minimum weight
spanning tree on an un-directed graph that connects the
vertices via weighted edges:

The input & output are read from a file, and format is as described in HackerRank:
First line, consists of two numbers - the number of nodes and the number of edges respectively.
The next M number of lines consists of three numbers - the edge represented as start and finish node and the weight:
The output is a single number - the sum of the total weight of the resulting graph.
